# Not Gonna Click It

## What is this?
Not Gonna Click It is a concept for a skill based minting procedure for digital collectibles.

Users can only collect a token once they have achieved a score of 50.

This means that they must either already posess the skills required, and make them a good fit for the community and likely to hang around, or they will have to spend the time building up their skills, at which point they will want a return on their time.

Both outcomes could reduce the number of people collecting tokens purely for profit and help community builders start their journey with a strong core of people.

## What do I get if I collect one?
A piece of generative art.
Proof that you have better than average clicking skills.
Future access to a competitive and rewarding game that requires a token to enter.

## Who made this?
The 3D models were created by XCOPY and Neonglitch86.
The game was created by 5030 studios, rekt5030 and bwcaboy.
